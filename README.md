# Dog-API
I have an idea of making a dog api to get random pictures of dog of all breeds.
i got the idea from https://dog.ceo/dog-api/breeds-list
I am using ASP.NET for this project  
I am having difficulties with using ASP.NET as it is still new to work with. 
I start with making a class dog service and menu
Also get a controller to handle http request which i get help with chat gpt how to use it.
By doing a little research on chat gpt it said we need to have a configuration in our start up class and also i can connect my html code with c sharp by have it in views. 
i was not aware how to dot it 
i searched and finally figure it out.
now i have all my codes but problem is that its not opening in website which is an issue with controller thet is not being correctly implemented probably. 
So i think to have all it right i need more practice or maybe approach it with different angle.
